In this paper we proposed a model for relation extraction from QnA data, which is capable of predicting relations between entities mentioned in question and answer sentences.
We conducted experiments on 2 publicly available CQA datasets and showed that our model can extract triples not available to existing sentence-based techniques and can be effectively combined with them for better coverage of a knowledge base population system.
