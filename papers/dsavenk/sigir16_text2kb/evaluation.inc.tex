We will evaluate on WebQuestions dataset, presented in \cite{Berant:EMNLP13}.
Hopefully we will show state of the art performance.

I will insert all results on WebQuestions from Codalab: https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xba659fe363cb46e7a505c5b6a774dc8a/


I also need to get text-only baseline (something similar to AskMSR++).

\subsection{Ablation Study}

We need to run our system without each of the major components and report results.
