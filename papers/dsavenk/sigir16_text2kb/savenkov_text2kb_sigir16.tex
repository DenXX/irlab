% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013

% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{When a Knowledge Base Is Not Enough: Question Answering over Knowledge Bases with External Text Data}


%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

One of the major challenges for knowledge base question answering systems (KBQA) is to translate a natural language question to knowledge base (KB) entities and predicates.
Previous systems have used a limited amount of training data to learn a lexicon that is later used for question answering.
This approach does not make use of other potentially relevant text data, outside the KB, which could enrich the available information.
We introduce a new system, Text2KB, that connects a KB with external text, specifically, we revisit different phases in the KBQA process and demonstrate that text resources improve question interpretation, candidate generation, filtering and ranking.
Starting with the best publicly available system, Text2KB utilizes web search results, community question answering and text document collection data, to detect question topic entities and enrich the features of the candidates derived from the KB.
Text2KB significantly improves on the initial KBQA system, and reaches the best known state of the art performance on a popular WebQuestions knowledge base question answering dataset.
The results and insights developed in this work are both practically useful, and can guide future efforts on combining textual and structured KB data for question answering.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

In this work showed that unstructured text resources can be effectively utilized for knowledge base question answering and improve query understanding, candidate generation and ranking.
We focused our attention on three particular sources of text information: web search results, community question answering data and text fragments around entity pair mentions.
Certaintly, there are more resources, that can be adopted, \eg entity profile pages like Wikipedia, Open IE knowledge bases, etc.

In the future, we plan to shift our attention to a more open setup, similar to the QALD hybrid task, where questions doesn't have to be answered completely from the KB.
This will probably require a new dataset, which we intent to build.
