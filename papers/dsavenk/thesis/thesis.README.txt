These thesis/dissertation template files were created by Andre Berger,
as was the original version of this README file.

Updated to meet Graduate School requirements as of 2009 and address
various LaTeX quirks by Fred Helenius.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(0) The Quick Tour:

	** copy all files, including those in the Preamble
	   subdirectory, to your own directory
	** change the contents of mythesis.tex, introduction.tex
	   chapterXX.tex, appendix.tex, thesis.bib
	** compile thesis.tex with pdflatex in your LaTeX system,
	   or run 'make' in a UNIX shell
	** the body of your thesis is done

	** go to the directory Preamble
	** change mydata.tex
	** compile preamble.tex with pdflatex in your LaTeX system,
	   or run 'make' in a UNIX shell
	** the preamble of your thesis is done

	** for printed copies, print both PDF files
	** for the final PDF file, use Adobe Acrobat to combine
	   the two PDF files

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(1) Copy the template files.

    You should have the following files:

	thesis.tex
	thesis.bib
	mythesis.tex
	introduction.tex
	chapter2.tex
	chapter3.tex
	appendix.tex
	Makefile
	algorithm.sty
	algorithmic.sty

	Preamble/preamble.tex
	Preamble/mydata.tex
	Preamble/Makefile

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(2) The file thesis.tex contains all the necessary formatting.
    It may not need to be changed at all.
    If you use packages not included in the template,
    add them in thesis.tex

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(3) In mythesis.tex include the names of the files you want
    to include.  Also comment/uncomment the commands for generating
    the list of tables, list of figures, list of algorithms
    accordingly.  Moreover, you should define your own commands
    here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(4) Add your thesis contents to the files introduction.tex,
    chapterXX.tex and appendix.tex

    Add your references to the file thesis.bib

    Known problem:  The \label command does not work as it
    should with the \mychapter command (it gives a section
    number from the preceding chapter).  If you want to refer
    to chapters, enter the number directly.  Be sure to check
    all such references if you renumber your chapters.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(5) Compilation:
    If you use TeXnicCenter or a similar TeX/LaTeX environment,
    use the "Build Output" command or equivalent.  Keep in mind
    that you need to compile twice for changes that affect the
    Table of Contents or List of Figures to propagate through
    the auxiliary files; bibliography changes may require you
    compile three times.

    Under UNIX, run 'make' in a shell and it will produce a
    Postscript and a PDF file of your thesis/dissertation.
    It will only run if any of the source files (including
    possibly figure files) have changed.
    All unnecessary files (.aux, .log, etc.) will be deleted
    after the compilation.
    Note: By default 'latex' is used, which accepts .eps files
    as images. If your images are .pdf or .jpg, you have
    to use pdflatex and change the Makefile accordingly.
    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(6) Math environments:
    The following environments are defined already:

    theorem, definition, proposition, fact, corollary, lemma,
    statement, claim, example, problem, question, conjecture

    The proof environment is also defined and it will put
    a square at the end of each proof by default. 
    The environment has one optional argument to replace
    the word proof with something else, e.g.

    \begin{proof}[Proof of the theorem from Section blablabla]
    ...
    \end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(7) The algorithm package:
    is very useful to typeset algorithms.
    See the template of chapter3.tex for a short example.
    Search the web for more documentation.  Be sure to
    turn on/turn off the list of algorithms in mythesis.tex

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(8) The preamble:
    In the directory Preamble, change your data in mydata.tex
    and run 'make' in a shell.
    This works if you have one advisor and two committee members.
    Otherwise you have to change preamble.tex in the appropriate
    places.
    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
(9) Preparing the final version:
    The ETD program insists that the PDF file you submit be
    created by Adobe Acrobat rather than pdflatex.  Adobe Acrobat
    is available for use at ECIT in the Woodruff Library and in
    the Cox Hall Computer Lab.

    After starting Adobe Acrobat, there are menu commands to
    import your two PDF files.  Make sure to import the preamble
    first.  Adobe Acrobat will then merge them into your final PDF.
