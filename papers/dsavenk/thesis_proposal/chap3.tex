\mychapter{Understanding Answer Contributions in CQA}

%Previous work has largely ignored a key problem in question recommendation, i.e., whether the potential answerer is likely to accept and answer the recommended questions in a timely manner. 

\noindent 
In this chapter, we summarize the proposed work and preliminary findings in understanding answer contributions in CQA systems (Research Question 1). In particular, we first focus on exploring the contextual factors that influence the answerer behavior in a large CQA system, and then study the effects of the information context of the answerer at the time a question is received on the answerers' reported ability, effort, and willingness to answer questions.  The goal is to inform the construction of question routing and recommendation systems.
