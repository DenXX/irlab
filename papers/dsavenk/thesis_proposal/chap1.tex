%\section{Contributions}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Modeling Answerer Behavior in CQA
%
%-- why? to improve effectiveness of CQA system, e.g. motivating answerers and improve answer quality.
%
%-- Exploring Web Browsing Context for Collaborative Question Answering
%
%-- why? to help answerers better answer questions and save effort.
%
%\item Predicting Web Searcher Satisfaction with Existing Community-based Answers
%
%-- why? to predict usefulness of CQA answers for satisfying web searchers' needs 
%
%-- considered queries that resulted in question clicks
%
%-- considered query clarity, query-question relevance, answer quality
%
%\item When Web Search Fails, Searchers Become Askers: Understanding the Transition
%
%-- why? to predict when searchers fail and suggesting asking questions would be helpful 
%
%-- considered characteristics of queries and sessions (and users TODO)
%
%-- considered query-question relations (explicit user feedback of questions)
%
%-- considered characteristics of questions posted by searchers
%
%\item use question clicks to improve ranking of general search results
%
%-- why? to make use of searchers' clicks on questions to better understand their needs and improve ranking
%
%-- considering queries that have question results in SERP
%
%-- considering using explicit feedback (e.g. questions) as well as implicit feedback (e.g. clicks)?

\section{Research Plan}

%In what follows, the status of the proposed work along with the corresponding references is listed.

\subsection{Understanding Answer Contributions in CQA (Chapter 3)}
\label{sec:plan1}


\subsection{Improving Search Quality with CQA Data (Chapter 5)}
\label{sec:plan3}


\subsection{Research Timeline}

\noindent A tentative timeline for the work that needs to be done is shown below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Completing the work proposed in Section \ref{sec:plan2} (10/2013 - 11/2013): For detecting implicit question intent in web search, build a better evaluation set, develop more features for the classifier and compare with more baselines.
\item Completing the work proposed in Section \ref{sec:plan3} (12/2013 - 04/2014): For improving question search for queries with question intent, develop models that build better query model and learn better word-to-word translation relationships based on the query-question click data and question category information.
\item \textbf{If time permits}, extending the work proposed in Section \ref{sec:plan3} (03/2014 - 04/2014): Extend the methods developed above for question search to achieve better query expansion and results ranking for general web search.
\item Thesis writing (05/2014 - 08/2014) 
\item Thesis defense (08/2014)
\end{itemize}
