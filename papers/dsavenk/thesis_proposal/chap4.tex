\mychapter{Non-factoid Question Answering}

%Many user users' information needs still cannot be satisfied by web search, but could be addressed by asking people via CQA services. 

\noindent
%In this chapter, we summarize the proposed work and preliminary findings in improving query understanding with CQA data (Research Question 2). In particular, we first focus on studying the types of web searches or information needs that lead to transition from searching to asking, and then try to identify implicit question intent in web search. The goal is to understand what types of queries would benefit most from CQA services and archives.
