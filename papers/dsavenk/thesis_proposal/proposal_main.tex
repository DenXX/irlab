\begin{abstract}

Modern search engines have made dramatic progress in answering many users questions, especially about facts, such as those that might be retrieved or directly inferred from a knowledge base.
However, many other questions that real users ask, \eg more complex factual, opinion or advice questions, are still largely beyond the competence of computer systems.
For such information needs users still have to dig into the ``10 blue links'' and extract relevant pieces of information.
As conversational agents become more popular, question answering (QA) systems are increasingly expected to handle such complex questions and provide users with helpful and concise information.
Unfortunately, a single method does not exist for all of the different QA needs.

The goal of my thesis is to improve the performance of question answering systems for solving users' information needs using various types of user generated content, such as text documents, curated knowledge bases, community question answering archives, and direct human contributions.
To achieve this goal, I propose first to focus on improving performance of automatic question answering by better utilization of available structured and unstructured data sources.
Next, I propose to look into possible direct inputs both from the external crowd of workers and the user who asked the question.
More specifically, the first part of my future thesis will study how to combine available unstructured text and structured knowledge base (KB) data for factoid question answering.
In the second part, I will build a non-factoid QA system that improves different stages of a pipeline by utilizing available unstructured and semi-structured (\eg question-answer pairs) data.
The next part will discuss crowdsourcing for near real-time question answering and study how to optimize its cost efficiency.
Finally, the last part of my thesis will focus on some aspects of user interactions with the question answering system, and how we can utilize this dialog to improve the success of the information seeking process.

Together, these techniques aim to improve performance of question answering over a variety of different questions a user might have, increasing the power and breadth of QA systems.

% -------------------

%Nowadays, there are a number of large open domain knowledge bases, that contain billions of facts about the world.
%However, their incompleteness and problems mapping from natural language questions to the structured queries, limits their scope to only a small subset of user factoid information needs.
%In my thesis I'm proposing a couple of new ways unstructured text data can be used to help knowledge base question answering.
%First, I propose a novel relation extraction model, that compliment KB data with facts extracted from community question answer data.
%And then, I describe a hybrid KB-Text QA system, that is based on semantic annotations of entity mentions in text documents.

%Non-factoid question answering is somewhat harder as it deals with a more diverse set of question and answer types.
%In my thesis I propose to improve performance of different stages of QA system pipeline by better utilization of the structure of a web page where a candidate answer is extracted from, and using deep learning techniques, inspired by recent successes in machine translation \cite{bahdanau2014neural}, text summarization \cite{rush-chopra-weston:2015:EMNLP}, automatic caption generation \cite{karpathy2015deep} and answer sentence scoring \cite{WangN15}.

%Unfortunately, there will always be cases when a system is unable to answer user's questions, \eg it might be ambiguous.
%In such cases a system can get back to the user with some kind of a suggestion or clarification.
%The focus of the last part of the thesis is on how to engage in an interaction with a user to improve the overall QA experience.
%I first describe strategic hints, which can help users to split complex information needs into smaller steps, which can be handled by the automated system.
%Next, I describe the proposal of research for automatic generation of clarification questions, which a system can ask to resolve ambiguities in the original query.
