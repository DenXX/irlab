\mychapter{Non-factoid Question Answering}

%A large number of search engine users benefit from CQA archives, by finding existing questions and answers that address their own search queries.

\noindent
% In this chapter, we summarize the proposed work and preliminary findings in improving search quality with CQA data (Research Question 3). In particular, we first focus on predicting searcher satisfaction with existing answers, and then try to improve retrieval of relevant questions for question-intent queries. The goal is to finally improve searcher satisfaction with CQA answers.
