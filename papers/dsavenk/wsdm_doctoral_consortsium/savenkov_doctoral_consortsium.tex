% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{Question Answering using Structured and Semi-structured User Generated Content}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*

Modern question answering (QA) systems employ a variety of different unstructured (text corpora), semi-structured (question answer pairs, infoboxes) and structured (knowledge bases) data sources for candidate generation.
However, typically each of the data sources is processed independently and the merging of the results happen only after the candidates are generated.
I propose to enrich the expressiveness of data representation of each of the data sources with complimentary information for joint reasoning.
More specifically, text documents that mention entities from a knowledge base (KB) can be extended with the information about properties and connections of these entities, and text fragments mentioning the entities and relations can help knowledge base question answering systems to find a good mapping between natural language questions and the corresponding structured query representations.

% This is probably not that related.
% I also propose to use existing QnA pairs from community question answering (CQA) websites both as training data for both text- and KB-based question answering systems.

\section{Why I want to attend the doctoral consortium}
During the course of my studies I've worked on a number of different topics, starting from click log analysis, mobile user behavior analysis, search user assistance and recently I've pivoted to information extraction and question answering.
Having focused on a general direction of my future research I would definitely benefit from attending the WSDM Doctoral Consortium, which would let me get an extended feedback from experienced researchers with potentially different views of the problem.
The topic of the proposed research involves several related areas, namely information retrieval, natural language processing, web search and mining, knowledge representation and knowledge base construction and querying.
Therefore, I would greatly appreciate a chance to discuss the proposed direction with researchers with experience in these areas.
This would complement the experience of my advisor and hopefully make my thesis work more useful for the community.

\section{A paragraph from the advisor}
A brief statement (1 paragraph) by their advisor saying how the student would benefit by attending the Consortium. Advisors should also specifically state whether the student has written, or is close to completing, a thesis proposal (or equivalent), and when they expect the student would defend their dissertation if they progress at a typical rate.
